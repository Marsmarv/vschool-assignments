            <p class="sideparagraph"><b>About the moon</b><br>The Moon is Earth's largest natural satellite, and we usually see it in the night sky.
                    Some other planets also have moons or natural satellites.
                    Our moon is about a quarter the size of the Earth. 
                    Because it is far away it looks small, about half a degree wide. 
                    The gravity on the moon is one-sixth of the Earth's gravity. 
                    It means that something will be six times lighter on the Moon than on Earth. 
                    The Moon is a rocky and dusty place. 
                    The Moon moves slowly away from the earth at a rate of 3.8cm per year, due to the effect of tidal dissapation.
                    The Moon being round, half of it is lit up by the sun. 
                    As it goes around (or orbits) the Earth, sometimes the side that people on Earth can see is all lit brightly. 
                    Other times only a small part of the side we see is lit.</p>
